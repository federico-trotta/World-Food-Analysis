# World Food Production Analysis

In this project I've analyzed the world food production, understanding the emissions for producing certain kind of food.

I found the most produced products and the most polluting, in certain world area.
Also, I've compared these results with the trand of the population and with the food waste, making some reasonings.

If you are not "a technician" or if you just want to understand the main concepts without reading the code, you can take a look at the PDF I created:

- [here](https://github.com/federico-trotta/World-Food-Analysis/blob/main/PDF/ITALIAN/Analisi%20della%20produzione%20mondiale%20di%20cibo.pdf) you find the Italian version
- [here](https://github.com/federico-trotta/World-Food-Analysis/blob/main/PDF/ENGLISH/World%20food%20production%20analysis.pdf) you find the English version

If you are interested in the code, for a better visualization (due to the library "Plotly") you may take a look at the project on my Kaggle account [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/federicotrotta/world-food-production-analysis)
