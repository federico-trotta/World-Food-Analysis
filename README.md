# World-Food-Production-Analysis

This is the first complete Data Science project I publish and it is derived from the "data manipulation and visualization" project 
for the course in Data Science I'm actually studying for.

The provided file is divided into chapters and derives from a Jupyter Notebook which has been used with a table of contents, linking every chapter.
The analysis has been commented after every plot, so you will find a file which is something pretty similar to a research paper.

Since I believe it is difficult to define when a Data Science project has finished, the last chapter provides furter analysis to do.

I'd appreciate every comment and advice.

Thanks for reading!
